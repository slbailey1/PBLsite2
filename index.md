I found this project interesting in multiple ways. For one, I got to mess around with coding again, especially with github pages (which gave me confidence that I'd be able to figure it out again.) I found the large elements the easiest, the titles, fonts, formatting, etc, but the small details, such as the way the lists should be formatted, very difficult. The content was also interesting. I have not thought about genetic engineering in years so it was nice to return and revise my opinions on it. The paragraph about ethics was quite interesting, I had to do research on people's actual opinions on it. That paragraph was decently easy to write though. I still have trouble with some vocabulary, though I think I have most of the information correct.
