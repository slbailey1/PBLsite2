I learned what GMOs are and how they are made. I learned in various ways how GMOs effect the environment. I learned the good and bad traits of a GMO. I learned what GMOs are used for and how they relate to genes and DNA. I learned the importance of GMOs and how it can shape our future.

I found this project interesting in multiple ways. For one, I got to mess around with coding again, especially with github pages (which gave me confidence that I'd be able to figure it out again.) I found the large elements the easiest, the titles, fonts, formatting, etc, but the small details, such as the way the lists should be formatted, very difficult. The content was also interesting. I have not thought about genetic engineering in years so it was nice to return and revise my opinions on it. The paragraph about ethics was quite interesting, I had to do research on people's actual opinions on it. That paragraph was decently easy to write though. I still have trouble with some vocabulary, though I think I have most of the information correct.
